# Facade_Pattern_Demo
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

Usage examples: The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in C#. It’s especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.

Identification: Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.

Summary:  Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
